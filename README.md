Feel free to help :)

Stuff I planned to do or that I'm doing so far (WIP):
- Add maps (Madra + the catacombs) DONE :D
- Add NPCs
- Add some docs (https://github.com/Tashiro-Gyori/goldensun_html5/wiki)
- Code: focus on some parts, UI especially (battle engine and the menu system + coming soon: text manager -> questions and yes/no answers, emojis etc.)
