# Golden Sun - HTML5

-> This is a fork of the project of @jjppof a Golden Sun Engine built in HTML5 with Phaser.

[DEMO](https://tashiro-gyori.github.io/goldensun_html5/)

Feel free to help :)

Stuff I planned to do (WIP):
- Add maps (Madra + the catacombs)
- Add NPCs
- Add some docs (https://github.com/Tashiro-Gyori/goldensun_html5/wiki)
- Code: focus on some parts, UI especially (battle engine and the menu system)
