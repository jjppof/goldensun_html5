Stuff I planned to do or that I'm doing so far (WIP):

whoops... I'm gonna add the world map and try to link with the battle test mode :D 
- Add NPCs
- Add some docs DONE :D
- Code: focus on some parts, UI especially (battle engine and the menu system + coming soon: text manager -> questions and yes/no answers, emojis etc.)
