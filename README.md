# Golden Sun Engine - HTML5

![golden sun html5](assets/images/misc/logo.jpg?raw=true)

An **Golden Sun Engine** entirely built in HTML5 with [PhaserJS CE 2.19.0](http://phaser.io/).

**See the [DEMO](https://jjppof.github.io/goldensun_html5/index).** Use Chromium based browsers. Don't use Firefox.

- With this project, **people should be able to make a GS like game without any programming skills**.
- **This repository is just the engine**. I'm not planning to do many maps, animations, items etc. Content here is just enough to show the functionalities.
- This project does not aim to do exactly the same engine as GS, but very similar.
- **WE NEED HELP!** Please, feel free to reach me if you want to do so. Join our [**discord server**](https://discord.gg/fYFSxPMjmS).
- If you found any bug, please create an [issue](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/issues/new) for it.
- Issues are not very well explained, feel free to reach me for details about them.
- Check the [wiki](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/wiki) for database configuration, tutorials and project tech information.
- This project deployment is a desktop application.

## Development environment

GS-HTML5 supports both Javascript (legacy) and Typescript. We use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to build the bundle and serve the development environment.
- I strongly recomend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to develop.
- Install dev dependencies by running `npm install` in the root folder.
- Use `npm start` to start the development server.
- Check the [general guidelines](https://github.com/jjppof/goldensun_html5/wiki#some-coding-guidelines) in order to contribute.
- Learn Phaser 2 by [examples](https://phaser.io/examples/v2) or by this [tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-2-game). For reference, check their [API](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/index.html).
- Check our [API docs](https://gshtml5.org/docs/) for quick reference.
